In a stunning display of contradictory thinking, Trump both threatened to leave NATO and complained that Europe was building independent military capabilities.

Trump: "Europe needs to defend itself!"
Also Trump: "How dare Europe build an army without us!"

## European Logic

"So... you want us to be independent but also dependent? Cool, cool." - Every EU defense minister
