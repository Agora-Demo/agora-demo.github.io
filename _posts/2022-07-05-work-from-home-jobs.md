excerpt: "When Trump visits Europe, leaders practice their fake smiles and count down the minutes until he leaves."
---

European leaders have developed a sophisticated protocol for Trump visits: minimize actual policy discussion, serve fast food, and hope he doesn't start an international incident on Twitter before boarding Air Force One.

## The Protocol

Step 1: Prepare elaborate state dinner. Step 2: Watch Trump ask for McDonald's. Step 3: Contemplate the meaning of diplomacy in the 21st century.

## What Trump Thinks Happened vs. What Actually Happened

Trump's version: "They loved me, everyone was very impressed." Europe's version: "That was exhausting. When does his plane leave?"

## The Aftermath

European diplomats writing their memoirs are going to make SO much money.
