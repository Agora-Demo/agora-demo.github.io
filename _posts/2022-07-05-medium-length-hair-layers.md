Europeans are enjoying front-row seats to the greatest reality TV show ever: American Democracy in Crisis. And they're learning valuable lessons about what happens when you let populism run wild.

## The Trump Effect on European Unity

Nothing unites Europeans quite like watching America fumble its way through basic governance. Brexit was bad, but at least the UK didn't try to overthrow its own government. Well, not recently anyway.

## Learning from America's Mistakes

Europe's new motto: "If Trump likes it, we should probably do the opposite." It's surprisingly effective policy-making.

## The Silver Lining

At least Europe has figured out that universal healthcare and functioning democracies are worth keeping. Thanks for the demonstration, America!
