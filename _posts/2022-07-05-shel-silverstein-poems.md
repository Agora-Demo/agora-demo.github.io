After years of threatening "Europe" as if it were a single entity, Trump has made the groundbreaking discovery that Europe is actually made up of multiple countries with different leaders, languages, and surprisingly, their own opinions!

## The Geography Lesson No One Asked For

"You mean there's more than just Germany and France?" Trump reportedly asked his advisors, who nodded wearily while contemplating their life choices.

## How to Lose Friends and Alienate Continents

Trump's approach to European diplomacy can be summarized as: threaten, insult, demand, complain, then act surprised when they ignore him. Revolutionary!

## The Future Is European

While America debates whether education is "woke," Europe is quietly building electric car infrastructure, investing in green energy, and generally being competent. Fascinating.
