As the UK struggles with Brexit consequences, Trump proudly claimed he "basically invented the whole thing," while EU leaders quietly sip their coffee and watch the show.

## The Quote

"I told them to leave, and they did. I'm basically the father of Brexit," Trump said, despite Boris Johnson never mentioning him once.

## Europe's Reaction

EU leaders: "Sure, Jan."
