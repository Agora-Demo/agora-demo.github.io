Trump's G7 appearance can be summarized as: showed up late, disagreed with everyone, suggested Russia should rejoin (no one agreed), then left early to play golf.

## The Highlight Reel

- Arrived 2 hours late
- Argued about climate change
- Suggested buying Greenland (again)
- Left before the final statement
- Tweeted angry things from the plane

## European Response

"Well, at least the coffee was good." - German diplomat
