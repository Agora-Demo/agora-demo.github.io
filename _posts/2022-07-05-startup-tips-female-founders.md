In a shocking development, European leaders have discovered that Trump's bombastic threats are significantly less effective when you just... don't engage.

## The Power of "Seen"

European diplomats have mastered the art of reading Trump's angry tweets, marking them as "seen," and then going back to building actual policy.

## Strategic Incompetence

"Oh sorry, we didn't understand that tweet, was that official US policy?" has become Europe's favorite response to 3 AM threats.

## The Result

While Trump rages about NATO spending, Europe is quietly building its own defense capabilities, green energy infrastructure, and a future that doesn't depend on American mood swings. Who knew competence could be so satisfying?
